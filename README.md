# Wolfram Extended neighborhood


Wolfram Elementary Cellular Automaton * 257

65536 instead of 256

This is using the arrangements of four cells to get the next cell in 

there is thus 16 bits rule length instead of 8 bit


coded in p5js 

how can you find interesting patterns in such a large search space?

multiplying interesting elementary CAs usually produce them

some decimal examples:

30* 257

7710

7966

43337 with random start


on a torus 

note the changes with even and odd cell lengths per generation

as the Automaton is displayed on a torus overlaps in size produce different results even for regular patterns like rule 90

the overlaps are affected by size of the canvas and screen and wether or not the number of cells is even or odd

my favorite overlap for rule 90 is a 51 cell row length

it produces something like a generative landscape
